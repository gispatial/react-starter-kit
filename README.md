## ðŸ‘‹ Intro

This boilerplate launches a [React web app](https://reactjs.org/).

The project is _super_ helpful to kick-start your next web app, as it provides a lot of the common tools you may reach for, all ready to go. Specifically:

- __Type checking__
    - [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- __Flux architecture__
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- __Routing and navigation__
    - [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for web
- __Data Caching / Offline__
    - [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
- __UI Toolkit__
    - [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for web

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
yarn install

# Starts are local live-reload server at:
# http://localhost:3000
yarn start
```

Via webpack, starts a localhost server on port 3000 [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

- Save code and it auto refreshes
- Install [Redux DevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) into Chrome to see the state of Redux


#### Bundle the app for production

```bash
yarn run build
```
